# Movie-Recommendation-System
Movie Recommendation System is my final year team-based project. It represents a fusion of technology and entertainment, dedicated to making users cinematic journey as enjoyable as possible.
Here after Data Cleaning pre-processing vectorization is done that helps to find similarity between movies easily. 'Bag of words' technique is used for vetorization and 'co-sine distance' is measured to claculate similarity.
Here user can also search movie according to their choices. Then our system will give them moresimilar types of movies as recommendation.
